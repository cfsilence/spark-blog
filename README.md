# Spark Blog

This project is a port of the custom blogware that I wrote in Grails 3 for my blog at http://recursive.codes.

It utilizes the following tech:

* Spark Java
* ActiveJDBC JavaLite
* Thymeleaf templates
* Groovy
* Gradle (Build Script)
* Bits and pieces of jQuery
* A minor experimental bit for Rivets.JS

There's not much to it.  When I wrote the original project I wanted a simple blog that I had control over the code and the style written in a language that I'm comfortable with.  Then I decided to port it as a learning exercise to get familiar with Spark Java, JavaLite and Thymeleaf.
